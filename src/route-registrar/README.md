route-registrar
===============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudfoundry-incubator/route-registrar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudfoundry-incubator/route-registrar)

A standalone executable written in golang that continuously broadcasts a route using NATS to the CF router.

This uses [yagnats](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/yagnats) for connecting to the NATS bus and [gibson](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gibson) for registering routes with the CloudFoundry router.

## Usage
